/**
 * This class implements an output stream for writing Snappy compressed data.
 * The output format is the stream header "snappy\0" followed by one or more
 * compressed blocks of data, each of which is preceded by a seven byte header.
 * <p/>
 * The first byte of the header is a flag indicating if the block is compressed
 * or not. A value of 0x00 means uncompressed, and 0x01 means compressed.
 * <p/>
 * The second and third bytes are the size of the block in the stream as a big
 * endian number. This value is never zero as empty blocks are never written.
 * The maximum allowed length is 32k (1 << 15).
 * <p/>
 * The remaining four byes are crc32c checksum of the user input data masked
 * with the following function: {@code ((crc >>> 15) | (crc << 17)) + 0xa282ead8 }
 * <p/>
 * An uncompressed block is simply copied from the input, thus guaranteeing
 * that the output is never larger than the input (not including the header).
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b>This data produced by this class is not compatible with the
 * {@code x-snappy-framed} specification. It can only be read by
 * {@link SnappyInputStream}.
 * </p>
 * @deprecated Prefer the use of {@link SnappyFramedOutputStream} which implements 
 * the standard {@code x-snappy-framed} specification.
